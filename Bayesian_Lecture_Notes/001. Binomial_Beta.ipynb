    "The aim of statistical inference is to make conclusions about a population based on a sample of data. Given a sample, it aims to estimate unknown parameters (such as the population mean or proportion) and assess the uncertainty around these estimates. Statistical inference uses methods like point estimation, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing to draw valid conclusions and make decisions based on the data.\n",

    "In the context of a binomial proportion, Bayesian statistical inference aims to estimate the proportion of successes in a population, given a sample. Using Bayes' theorem, prior beliefs about the proportion are updated with observed data to produce a posterior distribution for the proportion, capturing uncertainty and incorporating prior knowledge into the estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Beta distribution** is a natural choice for modeling the **binomial proportion** in a Bayesian context because it is a **conjugate prior** for the binomial likelihood. This means that when you update a Beta prior with binomial data, the resulting posterior distribution is also a Beta distribution \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the Beta distribution is flexible and defined on the interval [0, 1], which aligns perfectly with the possible values of a proportion. The shape of the Beta distribution can be easily adjusted using its parameters (α and β) to reflect different prior beliefs about the proportion \n",
