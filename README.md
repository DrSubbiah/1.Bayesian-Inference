## Introduction

This repository serves as a detailed guide to Bayesian statistics, covering fundamental concepts and advanced methodologies. The notes are structured to facilitate learning and provide practical examples, catering to beginners and those looking to deepen their expertise.

## Statistical Cultures

Delve into the various statistical cultures that inform Bayesian thinking. This section contrasts Bayesian and frequentist philosophies, highlighting their distinct approaches to uncertainty, inference, and model evaluation.

## Mathematical Functions and Distributions

Explore essential mathematical functions and probability distributions vital to Bayesian analysis. This section provides insights into how these tools are used to formulate models and interpret data.

## Bayes Theorem

An in-depth exploration of Bayes Theorem, including its derivation and significance. Practical examples with discrete probabilities illustrate its application in real-world scenarios, demonstrating how prior knowledge can be updated with new evidence.

## Simulation Techniques

### MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo)

Learn about Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, which are crucial for sampling from complex posterior distributions. This section covers key concepts, including convergence diagnostics and practical implementation.

### HMC (Hamiltonian Monte Carlo)

A comprehensive overview of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, a sophisticated sampling technique that leverages gradients for efficient exploration of parameter spaces. We discuss its advantages, limitations, and practical applications.

## Modeling Approaches

### Proportion Models

Gain insights into Bayesian methods for modeling proportions, including binary data analysis and the application of beta-binomial models.

### Count Models

Explore Bayesian techniques for count data, such as Poisson and negative binomial models. This section emphasizes the importance of proper model selection based on data characteristics.

### Normal Models

Understand the role of normal distributions in Bayesian inference, including applications in linear regression and hypothesis testing.

## Interpretation of Linear Models

This section covers the interpretation of linear models within a Bayesian framework, providing guidance on understanding coefficients, confidence intervals, and the impact of predictors on response variables.

## TensorFlow Probability (TFP)

An introduction to TensorFlow Probability, a library for probabilistic reasoning and statistical analysis in TensorFlow. We discuss its capabilities for building and training Bayesian models, emphasizing practical applications.

## Meta-Analysis

Learn about Bayesian approaches to meta-analysis, which allow for the synthesis of findings from multiple studies. This section discusses hierarchical modeling and the benefits of Bayesian inference in aggregating data.
